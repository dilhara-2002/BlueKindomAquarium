## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. Product Naming

- Include size/variety: "Large Angelfish", "Small Guppy"
- Be consistent with naming conventions

### 2. Pricing
- Use realistic prices in your local currency
- Consider market rates for similar products
- Include decimal places if needed: `150.50`

### 3. Stock Management
- Set realistic stock levels
- Update stock when products are sold
- Use `0` for out-of-stock items

### 4. Images
- Use high-quality images (recommended: 400x400px minimum)
- Ensure good lighting and clear product visibility
- Use consistent image backgrounds/angles

### 5. Product Management
- Keep product names descriptive and clear
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Update stock levels regularly

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **JSON Parse Error**
   - Check quotes: Use single quotes around JSON, double quotes inside
   - Validate JSON format online if needed

2. **Image Not Showing**
   - Verify image file exists in `server/uploads/products/`
   - Check filename matches Product ID exactly
   - Ensure image format is supported

3. **Database Connection Error**
   - Make sure MongoDB is running
   - Check `.env` file has correct MongoDB URI
   - Verify network connection

4. **Product Not Found**
   - Use correct Product ID (copy from list command)
   - Check if product was actually created
